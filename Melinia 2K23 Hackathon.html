<b>What is Health?</b>
</font>
</text>
<pre>
<font face= "Calibri" size="4" color="#65803F">
The World Health Organization defines health as “<i>a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity</i>”.
Yet, often we see mental health not being given priority in one’s life.

<pre>
1. <i>The stigma surrounding mental health issues-</i> Due to popular fiction and media, the nuances of mental health disorders are often lost. Mental illnesses may be simultaneously glamourised and 
demonized in today’s media. 
(See: <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2020/04/the-movie-joker-perpetuates-harmful-stereotypes-and-misinformation-about-mental-illness-study-finds/">Stereotypes about Mental Illness</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/04/14/the-problem-with-how-13-reasons-why-treats-suicide/">13 Reasons Why</a>)
2. <i>Extreme self-reliance-</i> From birth we are taught to be self-reliant. However, sometimes we need to accept that itis okay to need help.
3. <i>Stereotypes regarding therapy and treatment-</i> Therapists and other mental health professional get a bad rap in the media. They are often portrayed as insensitive or eccentric. Or they exacerbate the 
problem. Sometimes the therapy scene is played only for laughs or plot progress. 
(See: <a href="https://www.family-institute.org/behavioral-health-resources/cinematic-psychotherapy-stereotypes">Stereotypes about Therapy</a>)
4. <i>Unavailability of mental health professionals-</i> Maybe the person lives in an area with less mental health professionals. Or often minors are unable to seek help due to familial pressure.
